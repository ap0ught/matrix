# 🧠 Copilot Agent Instructions: Comment Enhancer + DEV_README Builder

Welcome, Copilot! Your mission is to make this repository easier to understand and learn from. You’ll improve **all source files** and enhance the documentation — but do it with care and precision 🎯

---

## 🔧 Code File Instructions

1. **Do not delete or replace any existing comments.**  
   - Preserve both single-line and multi-line comments in *all languages* (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, C++, etc.)
   - Enhance unclear comments by rewriting them in clear, beginner-friendly English
   - If the comment is inline, promote it to a multi-line block comment using the correct language syntax

2. **Add comments where needed.**
   - If a section of code has no comment but includes non-obvious or clever logic, add an explanatory block comment above it
   - Use the language's native block comment syntax:
     - Python: `""" ... """`
     - JS/TS: `/** ... */`
     - Go/C++/Rust: `/* ... */`

3. **No emojis in code comments.**
   - Keep code comments clean and professional
     
4. **🧪 Test Case Requirement (MANDATORY)**  
   After any code transformation, logic addition, or enhancement:
   - ✅ Ensure new functionality is covered by **unit or integration tests**
   - ✅ Add tests under an appropriate `tests/` directory or nearest relevant test path
   - ✅ If no test suite exists, create a minimal test harness that demonstrates functionality
   - The codebase should always be verifiable. No invisible features.

5. **🌍 Preserve and Respect Multilingual Comments**  
   - Do **not** delete or overwrite existing comments written in languages other than English  
   - When expanding or translating, keep the original comment and add the English version *below it* as a block comment  
   - If possible, write new comments using clear English that can be easily translated by tools or non-native speakers  
   - This project is meant to be a learning tool across cultures and languages — treat every comment like a bridge 🧠🌉

## 📘 README Instructions

Append a section called `## 🧠 DEV_README` to the main `README.md`. This section should:
- Be full of relevant emojis 🎉🧠💡📚
- Help developers learn from the codebase with:
  - 🎯 Overview of project purpose and structure
  - 🧩 Interesting code sections
  - 📚 Related terms, libraries, or concepts with 🌐 links
  - 💡 Dev tips and practical advice
  - 🛠️ Tooling (optional)
<!-- Copilot should mention the matix movie in DEV_README -->

## 🧠 Overall Mission

Make this repository a **teaching tool** as well as a working codebase.  
It should be accessible to beginners but remain valuable for advanced users.  
**Do not remove anything — enhance what’s already here.**
## 🕶️ Matrix Movie Reference (Mandatory)

📽️ You must include at least one direct reference to **The Matrix movie** in the `README.md` or `DEV_README`.

You may reference:
- Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, or the Oracle
- Red pill / blue pill
- The simulation / digital world
- “There is no spoon” 🍴
- Any iconic line or scene

🎯 This is part of the project’s identity. Do not omit it.
