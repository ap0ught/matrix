/*
 * Color Space Conversion Utility
 *
 * This module converts colors between different color spaces, primarily
 * from HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) to RGB (Red, Green, Blue).
 *
 * In the context of the Matrix, different color spaces represent different
 * ways of perceiving and manipulating the digital reality. HSL provides
 * intuitive control over color properties that users can understand,
 * while RGB represents the raw pixel values needed by computer graphics.
 *
 * @param {Object} colorSpec - Color specification object
 * @param {string} colorSpec.space - Color space ("rgb" or "hsl")
 * @param {Array<number>} colorSpec.values - Color values in the specified space
 * @returns {Array<number>} RGB color values [red, green, blue] in range 0-1

	 * HSL to RGB Conversion Algorithm
	 *
	 * This implements the standard HSL-to-RGB conversion using the

	 *
	 * The algorithm works by:
	 * 1. Calculate chroma (color intensity) based on saturation and lightness
	 * 2. Use a helper function to determine RGB components based on hue position
	 * 3. Apply lightness adjustment to achieve final RGB values

	 * Chroma Calculation
	 * Chroma represents the "colorfulness" - how far the color deviates from gray.
	 * Formula: C = S Ã— (1 - |2L - 1|)
	 * This ensures maximum chroma occurs at 50% lightness (L=0.5).

	 *
	 * @param {number} n - Component offset (0 for red, 8 for green, 4 for blue)
	 * @returns {number} RGB component value in range 0-1

		/*
		 * Piecewise Linear RGB Calculation
		 * The color wheel is divided into 6 main segments, each covering 2 units.
		 * This formula determines how much of the chroma contributes to this

		 * - Linear interpolation during transitions
		 * - No contribution when far from the component's range

	 * - f(4): Blue component (starts at hue position 4/12 = 120 degrees)
